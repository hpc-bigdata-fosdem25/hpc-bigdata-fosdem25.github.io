### Overview

<strong><a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/hpc/">Devroom schedule is available on FOSDEM'25 website!</a></strong>
</p>

Welcome to the 10th edition of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science devroom,
co-located with [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/). FOSDEM is an annual
conference about free and open source software, attended by over 8,000
developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world.
This devroom is organised by representatives of the HPC, Big Data, and Data Science communities,
who are joining forces to bring them together.

- High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data are two important approaches to scientific computing.
  HPC typically deals with smaller, highly structured data sets and huge amounts of computation while
  Big Data, not surprisingly, deals with gigantic, unstructured data sets or data streams, usually
  processed with the help of distributed systems.
  When the Big Data trend unlocked access to an unprecedented amount of data, Data
  Science emerged to tackle the problem of creating processes and approaches to extracting
  knowledge or insights from these data sets. Machine learning and predictive analytics algorithms
  have joined the family of more traditional HPC algorithms and are pushing the requirements of
  cluster and data scalability.

- Free and Open Source communities have been the foundation of the HPC and Big Data communities
  for some time. In the HPC community, it should be no surprise that, according to the
  [Top500 supercomputers list](http://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1), 100% of the
  supercomputers in the world run Linux.
  On the Big Data side, the Apache Big Data ecosystem (e.g. Apache Hadoop/Flink/Spark/Kafka) received a
  tremendous amount of Open Source contributions from a wide range of organizations coming together
  under the Apache Software Foundation.
  The data science community also thrives on open source, with the Python ecosystem around pandas/Tensorflow/PyTorch
  and the R ecosystem being the two pillars.

- Our goal is to bring the communities together, share expertise, learn how we can benefit from each
  other's work and foster further joint research and collaboration. We welcome talks about Free and Open Source
  solutions to the challenges presented by large scale computing, data management and data analysis.

[FOSDEM'25 will be a hybrid event](https://fosdem.org/2025),
with the HPC, Big Data, and Data Science devroom taking place physically on <strong>Sunday 2 February 2025</strong>.

Join us to enjoy a variety of talks, demos and interesting discussions on open-source HPC, Big Data and Data Science.

Sounds interesting? Submit your talk proposal below, and see you in Brussels!
