We are proud to announce the 7th edition of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science devroom at FOSDEM 2022.

The devroom will take place *online* during the weekend of 5-6 Feb 2022,
and is open for everybody to join (no registration required).

Join us to enjoy a variety of talks, demos and interesting discussions on open-source HPC, Big Data and Data Science.

Sounds interesting? Submit your talk proposal and see you (virtually) at FOSDEM'22!

Submissions are light weight: basically talk title + short description, plain text.
Accepted talks will need to be pre-recorded by mid Jan'22.
